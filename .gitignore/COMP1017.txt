1. Cascade
	- Remove all default values first
	- Priority of up of page to down of page
	- Up of page set everything to zero, and overwrite below

2. Inheritance
	- Getting something from the parent
	- Like a disease, other's get effected.

<html> // this will inherent everything
	<body>
		<main>
			<p>

3. Specificity
	- The most specific you target a rule
	- Example: p { color:red }
	- vs Example: .class { color:blue }
	- More specific = more precedent// priority
	- Based on ELEMENT you SELECTED.

4. Box Model
	- Where all contents are built upon
	- Every content has it's own box
	- Everything with a tag is content?
Width: Content+ Padding + Margin + Border

Margin is not part of the content.*
	- margin: 12px, 20px, 50px, 100px; }
	- Top-> Right-> Bottom ->Left
Border
	- border: 3px solid blue; }
	- Equals to 6px added to the width, 3px left, 3px right of border
Padding
	- padding: 24px 0px 0px 0px;
	- Same as margin: Top --> Right --> Bottom --> Left
