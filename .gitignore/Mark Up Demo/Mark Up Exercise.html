				This weeks featured game is Dark Souls III a game of valleys and peaks, down through dungeons and up over castle walls. It's a plummet into places we shouldn't be, an escape from places we don't belong.
				But of course, we fight our way through the darkness, and find our way out. There are a few stumbles along the way, but in the end, Dark Souls III is well worth the riveting climb.
				Final Fantasy 15 will launch on September 30, 2016 publisher Square Enix has announced. The date was revealed during the Uncovered: Final Fantasy XV event, which is being held in Los Angeles.
